# Packetbeat Agent configuration file.
#
# Packetbeat is a protocol monitoring service that
# works by sniffing the network traffic between your application
# components. It dumps the results into Elasticsearch.

# Go to http://packetbeat.com/getstarted for more details.

[runoptions]
# The Packetbeat agent can drop privileges after creating the sniffing
# socket. Root access is required for opening the socket but everything
# else requires no privileges. Therefore, it is strongly recommended
# to have the Agent switch users after the initialization phase.
# The following two settings set the User Id and the Group Id under
# which the Agent will run.
# Warning: Because on Linux Setuid doesn't change the uid of all threads,
# the Go garbage collector will continue to run as root.
# Note: Process monitoring only works when running as root.

gid=<%= @gid %>

[logging]
# These are debug helpers to control the verbosity of logging.

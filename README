# puppet-packetbeat
This module installs the packet beat agent and a baseline configuration.

In the role for your packetbeat node simply: 

```ruby
class { ::packetbeat:
    aggregator => ${IP_ADDRESS_TO_AGGREGATOR} or ${AGGREGATOR_FQDN},
}
```

If this is running on the same box as your aggregator I'd suggest using the FQDN and not localhost. 

## Common Patterns
Commonly packetbeat is deployed with an ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana). For large scale distribution and asynchronous agent transactions
it's also deployed with redis. There are a lot of modules out there to get you setup for those four services.

This module is designed to install and configure only packetbeat. However, if you'd like the full stack checkout:

* elasticsearch/elasticsearch (Forge)
* github.com:malnick/puppet-logstash
* kibana3 (forge)

Some of these needed massaging and others did not, your mileage will vary.
